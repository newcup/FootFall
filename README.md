# FootFall

A website and Android application for the 2017 SHAD John Dobson Entrepreneurship Cup. This year, the theme was, "How can Canadians meaningfully reduce our
individual energy footprints, to achieve a significant collective impact?". With this question, our team, from SHAD Queens, came up with FootFall, a company creating a comprehensive piezoelectric tile that could generate electricity, relaying valuable data to customers such as malls, airports, and stores. Using a template from freehtml5.co, we created a website to inform others and to promote our company.
